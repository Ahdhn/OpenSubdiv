#     including the license conditions and limitations in section 3,
#     each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,

#     its contribution or any derivative works that you create.
#     (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license,
#     including the license conditions and limitations in section 3,
#     each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
